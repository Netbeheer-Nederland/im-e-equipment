    description: 'A wire or combination of wires, with consistent electrical characteristics,
      building a single electrical system, used to carry alternating current between
      points in the power system.

      For symmetrical, transposed three phase lines, it is sufficient to use attributes
      of the line segment, which describe impedances and admittances for the entire
      length of the segment.  Additionally impedances can be computed by using length
      and associated per length impedances.

      The BaseVoltage at the two ends of ACLineSegments in a Line shall have the same
      BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage. However, boundary lines may have slightly different
      BaseVoltage.nominalVoltages and variation is allowed. Larger voltage difference
      in general requires use of an equivalent branch.'

      1) for a two Terminal PowerTransformer the high voltage (TransformerEnd.endNumber=1)
      PowerTransformerEnd has non zero values on r, r0, x, and x0 while the low voltage
      (TransformerEnd.endNumber=2) PowerTransformerEnd has zero values for r, r0,
      x, and x0.  Parameters are always provided, even if the PowerTransformerEnds
      have the same rated voltage.  In this case, the parameters are provided at the
      PowerTransformerEnd which has TransformerEnd.endNumber equal to 1.

      2) for a three Terminal PowerTransformer the three PowerTransformerEnds represent
      a star equivalent with each leg in the star represented by r, r0, x, and x0
      values.

      3) For a three Terminal transformer each PowerTransformerEnd shall have g, g0,
      b and b0 values corresponding to the no load losses distributed on the three
      PowerTransformerEnds. The total no load loss shunt impedances may also be placed
      at one of the PowerTransformerEnds, preferably the end numbered 1, having the
      shunt values on end 1.  This is the preferred way.

      4) for a PowerTransformer with more than three Terminals the PowerTransformerEnd
      impedance values cannot be used. Instead use the TransformerMeshImpedance or
      split the transformer into multiple PowerTransformers.

      Each PowerTransformerEnd must be contained by a PowerTransformer. Because a
